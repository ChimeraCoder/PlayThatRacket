Play That Racket!
===============

Play That Racket! provides a vision for an alternative musical structure, one which allows composers the flexibility to highlight similarities between any two pieces of music, the freedom to define partial compositions, and a format to express truly modern symphonies programatically. 

With Play That Racket!, it is easy to define semi-random compositions like the following:


````scheme
((lambda (a b c)
  (map scramble (list (keyshift-A-to-D a) rest ((random-element crazy-functions) b) rest c rest c rest a rest b))) 
 (list A A E5 E5 F5♯ F5♯ E5)
 (list D5 D5 C5♯ C5♯ B B A) 
 (list E5 E5 D5 D5 C5♯ C5♯ B)) 
````

No two performances will be the same!

Examples
===========

Some sample programs have been placed in the `examples/` folder, and can be run directly with racket:

````
> racket examples/chromatic_scale.rkt
````

or


````
> racket examples/twinkle_twinkle_little_star.rkt
````

...etc.


Requirements
=========

Play That Racket! is written in Racket and has been tested on Linux using version 5.3.1, though it will likely work with other versions of Racket and on other systems as well. 



TODO
========
Lots! Consider this version 0.1 - a preview, if you will. Some stuff that still needs to be done:

* Proper racket-style packaging of the libraries
* Better abstraction of functions for changing keys, using intelligent macros
* Use other sound backends (rsound is currently the only one supported)
* Provide options for changing instrumentation/timbre/etc.
